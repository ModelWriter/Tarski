h1. Intent - tooling for writing useful and synchronized documentation

Intent is a tool allowing developers to easily write a documentation up-to-date with any development artifact (models, code, environment...). 
The documentation, integrated with other Eclipse tools, then becomes truly useful and is no longer a burden that developer have to carry to please their customers or their project manager. 
Based on Donald Knuth's Literate Programming concepts and allowing collaborative work around design tasks, Intent will try to reconcile developers with Documentation.
